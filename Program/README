Greetings:

    The latest version exists at the following path in the Unison
release tree:

    /ltx/customer/unit_test/AUT/BinChecker/BinChecker.una
    /ltx/customer/unit_test/AUT/BinChecker/README

    The program support 256 sites, for software/hardware bins MIN_BIN and MAX_BIN.
In this case, the definitions are as follows:

		MIN_BIN = 0
		MAX_BIN = 256

	All ExtInterface Objects exist in the program for each EIM that exists in
the Unison CURI software.

    The program has TestOptions which can be used to your advantage
in debugging/proving interface operation.

    MaxHardwareBin = This is the maximum number of bins the EIM supports.
                     If your EIM supports bins 0-7, then enter 8 for this
                     value. If the EIM supports bins 0-31, then enter 32
	             for this value.

    RandomBinning = This boolean options allows random bin generation to each
                    of the sites when TRUE.  When FALSE, the bin sent to
                    each site is determined by SitenConstBin TestOptions where
                    n = 1 through 16.

    SitenConstBin = The bin sent to Site n when RandomBinning is FALSE. The
	            values are limited between MIN_BIN and MAX_BIN.


    You can turn the Datalog ON and see that the bin sent to a given site matches
the actual value calculated.  Both BinTool, Datalog, and handler should correlate
for each site.

    Load the program, then Set the Active EIM to your choice.  You can then save the
program, release and re-load, or just proceed from there.  This program will allow
you to verify all forms of EIM interfacing in Unison and the handlers supported
through CURI.

    This program should work even for Single Site EIM drivers.

Good Luck,
